# Self-watering Plant Device for B2B using Arduino

The goal of the project was to develop a prototype that waters a minimum of 5 plants automatically using the Arduino platform.
The challenges were the craftwork (wood, plastic, electronics) and combining this with water. To provide water to every plant pot equally I needed to iterate on the hose system. Additionally, C++ was new to me and I needed to learn it from scratch.

Currently, the prototype is working well, the plants are growing nicely. The next steps are a growing light system for the darker months and a different base construction to be able to plug the device on a wall.
